Most vitally, the Haskell version is more type-safe, less likely to cause a runtime exception, is source-portable, executes faster and took less time to write (even though I wrote the Haskell from scratch, and translated into Java!)\n3. Maybe the Haskell runtime does the same amount of object creation, but I think that creating one object in the Haskell heap is faster then creating one object in the Java heap, for low-level reasons.\n4.

Haskell is an order of magnitude better than C++, and maybe Java.\n10. So, here is a short list of entirely pragmatic, practical, and non-theoretical reasons why Haskell is superior to Java for implementing enterprise programs.\n11. If anything, the Haskell version should be slower because it is not tail recursive, whereas the Java version uses a loop which is the fastest looping construct available in Java.\n12.

IMHO, Erlang is definitely easier to digest than Haskell.\n15. It is written in Java, and might scales better over Haskell than Erlang, yet I find some \"operations\" to be more intuitive using emacs (plain text editing) than creating \"tempo\" objects to fit functional's lazyness :/ .\n16. This is arguably one area where Java does better than Haskell.\n17. Well, no: our Java code looks better than our Haskell code because we have used good Java practices and bad Haskell practices.\n18. Haskell is infinitely slower than Java for our main platform, because it is not ported to said platform, so Haskell sucks... -  user1249 Feb 7 '11 at 19:32 .\n19. Also note that the Haskell benchmarks may be 10x slower than Java ones in the worst case, but the gap is much smaller for most Scala benchmarks.\n20.

Java is also generally faster than Groovy, even in cases where Groovy's performance has been improved [1][3].\n\nUltimately, the choice between Java and Groovy may depend on specific project needs, personal preferences, and experience with either language.

Our native pine and forestry system produces timber faster than we can cut it and yet we have only pricked the surface of the great lumber and pulp potential.\n10. Again, the timber cut from the lower end of the belt contains a greater percentage of refuse and less clear lumber than that fi-om Humboldt, Trini- dad or Crescent City.\n11. As a timber tree, yellow pine is generally very knotty and inferior to other pines and is more frequently used for framing lumber, railroad ties, crates and fencing.\n12.

When asked why board feet of lumber declined faster than the Index (which includes payroll as well as board feet of lumber), an insider of the timber industry was able to offer this explanation: .\n16. Initially, the technique was called \"balloon framing\" because the 2 x 4 and 2 x 6 framing members (dimensional lumber) were so much lighter than in heavy timber.\n17. As the amount of lumber actually cut from the log averages about 20 per cent greater than the log measure, it is safe to say that the timber used for veneer stock would have made some 166,000,000 feet of ordinary lumber.\n18. As one of the largest lumber mills in the area we utilize technologically superior equipment that enables us to pay top dollar for your timber.\n19.

No, Netbeans doesn't support Facelets either but it seems to have better server (start/restart/deploy) support than MyEclipse, better UML support and it seems faster than Eclipse and definitely lower mem footprint.\n5. I have the \"Netbeans RCP\" book at home, I built some examples with it, and it basically is all just a bit easier and nicer to use than Eclipse RCP.\n6. BTW, I must say that NetBeans has several performance problems, so I rather did some easier refactoring by hand (it was much faster than NB ) or used Eclipse and find/sed for some tasks.\n7. Regarding NetBeans, Milinkovich said Sun does a good job of marketing the things NetBeans does better than Eclipse, such as Java profiling and GUI building with the Matisse technology.\n8.

UI Response : What ever may be the reason, Eclipse is definitely faster and it has better response times than NetBeans.\n14. There are some features I miss from Eclipse (better code completion, auto serial id generator, better missing import handling, quicker project openning, etc.) but overall I feel more comfortable using Netbeans with ExtJS projects than Eclipse.\n15. I've always heard people saying that eclipse editor is superior to netbeans.\n16.

The New Standard Issue Drawing from military convention, we fabricated our footlocker in the USA from a powder coated steel, making it lighter and more durable than the plywood counterpart.\n4. An available option for interior sidewalls is the extremely durable SSL lining, which consists of a layer of 0.019\" 80,000 psi galvalume steel over a rigid core to produce an interior lining far superior to plywood or plastic offerings.\n5. You can spot hits by seeing movement upon impact by seeing impact zone-bullet splatter on white painted steel is way easier to see than a small hole in plywood.\n6. It's designed specifically for Dodge Ram pickups made from 2009 onward, and the custom-made steel frame, tough HDPE cover, and simple installation make it miles better than any plywood-and-2x4 concoction.\n7.

As plywood is lighter, stronger and cheaper than steel it really does become a great contender for the amateur boat builder.\n15. Expanded metal therefore needs more support structure below, so ultimately, timber or structural plywood ramps end up being lighter and cheaper than steel.\n16. AmTab 3/4\" plywood-core provides superior strength, along with square-tubular steel legs for dependable stability.\n17. Glassed inside and out with quality laminates and epoxy resins, the plywood boat would have far and away less maintenance costs and would have a much lighter hull weight than steel, thereby having considerably better sailing characteristics in all ways.\n18. These bits feature super-strength superior steel body, Non-Stick Orange Shield Coating and cutting edges made of SinterHip Hi-Density Industrial Chrome Carbide for a long-lasting performance.\n19. To assert that an assemblage of concrete Doric columns or coloured plywood pilasters is somehow automatically superior to a building using pilotis or steel frame stanchions, or to assert the exact opposite, is to reduce criticism to a pretty silly level: fashion versus old habits.\n20. \"Despite the fact that articles of plastics are usually lighter than those of metal and that economies may be affected in fabrication, the price differential between plastics and, for example, steel is so great as to discourage large-scale substitution.\n\nAfter the summary, list the arguments you used below the text.

It's better than the plastic container on several levels and for me, it's worth the extra money.\n13. This tactic is better than utilizing plastic, because it will allow air to circulate.\n14. Because cement mortar has greater compressive strength than required for most ordinary brickwork and because it is not very plastic by itself it is sometimes mixed with lime and sand.\n15. I think most pros would tell you that waterproofing on top of the cement board is better practice than using the plastic or the felt paper underneath it.\n16. Or if not cement, maybe chocolate, with accuracy that's good enough and much better speed than the plastic-based extruder models.\n17. In the past we have used neoprene rubber shims of a similar size which I think work better than the plastic.\n18. Different materials have different freezing points as well, cement roads seem to ice up faster than tar pavements, and steel, plastic and glass all frost over at different rates.\n19. The sculptor then takes ordinary, sand-based patching cement (faster drying and yet more plastic than its stone-based, sidewalk cousin) and layers it over the armature from the bottom up.\n20. Fiber cement siding tends to have better longevity than wood or plastic-based products because it resists cracking, warping, rot, and pest damage-even after exposure to harsh temperature and moisture.\n\nAfter the summary, list the arguments you used below the text.

It's also suitable for applications that require high compressive strength [14]. Cement tanks, for example, are easier to clean and maintain than bare cement tanks [2]. Cement mortars mixed with lime and sand can also enhance its plasticity for use in brickwork [14].
