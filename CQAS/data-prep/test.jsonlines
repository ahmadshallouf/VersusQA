The Nikon AF-S 80-400mm is slightly lighter and of course better appointed than the Sigma's, although the Sigma was no slouch.\n2. Nikon 10-24 is more useful, better built, faster to focus, easer to manually override AF if needed, sharper and therefore better than Sigma 10-20.\n3. Canon isn't much better, though: They pump out new APS-C bodies faster than most people change their underwear - but their EF-S lenses are completely incompatible with their FF bodies (they don't have a crop mode like Nikon).\n4. Nikon glass will always be superior to Sigma.\n5. I think most people see Sigma cameras and lenses as inferior to brands like Nikon and Canon.\n6. I could imagine if you would want a lighter and smaller option, the Nikon is better than the Sigma.\n7. My Nikon 14mm-24mm zoom, at 14mm, is clearly superior to a Sigma 14mm f2.8 I have and in my opinion, slightly better than my Nikon 14mm f2.8.\n8. 1 stop faster than the Nikon and I like the color rendition better than the Sigma 10-20 which I used to have.\n9. I'm sure Nikon can do better than Sigma.\n10. On the one hand you have some who would claim that anything badged as Nikon or Canon is superior to anything badged Sigma.\n11. It definitely focuses faster and works better than a nikon G in low light conditions.\n12. The Sigma has faster autofocus but the Tamron had even better IQ than the Nikon 18-200, what a dilemma .\n13. If they can make it better than there 60mm (which I bought, as it was FAR superior to the nikon macros I tried) it will be well worth the price, and maybe even better than the nikon 105mm .\n14. Sigma 17-70 HSM OS + better range than the 18-55 + faster (but not as fast as the Tamron) + 9\" min focus - macro use + cheaper than Nikon .\n15. The sigma is much faster focusing and better then the Nikon 1.4 g in the center at all of the low apertures.\n16. It did however, focus faster and quieter than my old Nikon 70-200 and was lighter.\n17. The Sigma and Tamron are superior to the Nikon, because .\n18. I believe Sigma 24-105 has better optics than 24-105 Canon kit or 24-120 Nikon, and superior to 24-85 Nikon kit I own.\n19. Build quality is superior to Sigma and Tamron and certainly the same or better than canon and nikon equivalents.\n20. Generally it's slightly better than the Nikon 18-200 but and slightly worse than my huge Nikon 28-70 and 80-200 f2.8 AF-S lenses.\n\nAfter the summary, list the arguments you used below the text.
