Moreover, Python has good XML parsers and handles some types of tasks better than Bash. Some people also find Python easier to program in, since it has fewer escaping scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand, some users argue that Bash is faster than Python for some operations, and it could be easier to write scripts in Bash for some tasks.
