Reagan faced an even greater worry than Kennedy - that he was a scripted movie actor who couldn't be trusted with war and peace.\n6. Reagan understood and respected the power of his words, and he understood better than anyone since FDR (yes, better than Kennedy) the power of presidential discourse in making great things possible.\n7. Reagan understood, better than any president this side of John Kennedy , that people's perceptions of his conduct were as important as what he was actually doing.\n8. Sandra Day O'Connor was a brilliant choice by President Reagan -- a surprise -- never as popular with the conservatives as Antonin Scalia, but far better than Anthony Kennedy.\n9. It was the GOP of Mitt Romney, circa 1994, when he ran for U.S. senator in Massachusetts as a pro-choice, anti-Reagan Republican who said he'd protect gay rights better than incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy.\n10. Indeed, Obama may be doing Reagan one better, as nominating Kagan presents the possibility of getting two liberal equivalents to Kennedy rather than just one, as getting even a mainstream liberal confirmed in a closely divided Senate will be difficult.\n11. Ted Kennedy would have been a much better president than Reagan or Carter.\n12. In 1964, Democratic President Kennedy's tax cuts represented 8.8 percent of the budget-far greater than even the Bush or Reagan tax cuts.\n13. Oh, and lest we not forget that Kennedy and Johnson had farm better job creation than Reagan.\n14. In the Reagan administration the top marginal rate was cut to 28 percent, and the cuts were phased in slower than the Kennedy cuts.\n15. What Kennedy could do better than any president in my lifetime-even Reagan-was deliver a speech that expressed America's ideals and reinforced his audience's belief in them.\n16. Kennedy, LBJ, Carter and Clinton were far superior fiscal managers than Nixon, Reagan, Bush I and Bush II.\n17. Like them or not, FDR, Kennedy and Truman had a greater impact on the direction and climate in America than any so called conservative President in American History other than Ronald Reagan.\n18. We felt it before, in the idealism of John F. Kennedy calling us to serve a cause greater than ourselves, and in the strength of Ronald Reagan calling for a wall to be torn down.\n19. Lincoln united a nation divided, Roosevelt lifted a people when hope had run out, Kennedy inspired a generation to serve a cause greater than one's self and to literally reach for the stars, Reagan brought peace and freedom through strength and resolve.\n\nAfter the summary, list the arguments you used below the text.

The last two, potentially winnable swing states were lost without a battle - Virginia, where Kerry ran 3 points worse than expected and Missouri, where he ran 4 points below expectations.\n8. Here, living in mid-Missouri, tracking my spending by food type is rote, it's how I order much of what we consume, so understanding where I spend on food is much easier here than in Virginia.\n9.
